# Product Context

This project aims to integrate AWS S3 for document version control to provide a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solution for managing document versions.

**Problems Solved:**

*   Limited storage capacity for document versions.
*   Lack of a centralized system for managing document versions.
*   Difficulty in tracking and restoring older versions of documents.

**How it Should Work:**

The application should allow users to upload documents to AWS S3, automatically versioning each new upload. Users should be able to view the version history of a document, download specific versions, and restore older versions. Metadata about each version (file name, version, upload date, user info, etc.) should be stored in a database.

**User Experience Goals:**

*   Provide a simple and intuitive interface for uploading and managing document versions.
*   Ensure that document versions are stored securely and reliably.
*   Enable users to easily track and restore older versions of documents.
