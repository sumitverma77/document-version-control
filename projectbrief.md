# Project Brief

**Project Goal:** Integrate AWS S3 for document version control and learn about AWS services.

**Functionalities:**

*   Users can upload documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, TXT).
*   Each time a user uploads a new version of the same document, it's versioned (e.g., v1, v2â€¦).
*   Users can view version history, download specific versions, or restore older versions.
*   All versions are stored in S3.
*   Metadata (file name, version, upload date, user info, etc.) is stored in a database.
